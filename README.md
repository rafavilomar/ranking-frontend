# Ranking

Ranking is a platform for students by students where users can express their opinions and thoughts about teachers, making votes and writing optional comments.

This repository is the frontend side for the platform, but if you want to run the project locally you need to run the backend side also. 

You can clone the backend project and see more details about the API [here](https://github.com/rafavilomar/ranking-backend).

## Why Ranking

The reason behind Ranking, and to be specific about this repository, is because I was looking for an excuse to test and learn to use tools like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
